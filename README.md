VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

In this homework assignment I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

I also used conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
